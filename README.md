# Automatic Paper Cutter using Geneva Mechanism ✂️⚙️

A course project for the Kinematics of Machinery course, this automatic paper cutter simulates continuous feed cutting using a Geneva mechanism. 
The design was modeled in CAD and analyzed for motion efficiency and precision. Ideal for educational and prototyping applications involving intermittent motion control.


## 💡 Key Features

- Geneva mechanism for controlled intermittent motion
- Automatic synchronization between feed and cut
- Designed using [ SolidWorks & Fusion 360]
- Simulated kinematic analysis in MATLAB 
- Scalable mechanical concept for industrial use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- CAD Modeling: [SolidWorks & Fusion 360]
- Simulation: [MATLAB / Simulink]
